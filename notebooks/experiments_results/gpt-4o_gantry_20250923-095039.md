# Step 3: Cause and Effect Chain Analysis (CECA)

In this step, we conducted a Cause and Effect Chain Analysis (CECA) to identify the root causes of the critical issues affecting the gantry crane system. The following root causes were identified:

## Excessive Swinging of the Load
1. **High Speed Movement**: The crane moves the load at high speeds, leading to excessive swinging.
   - **Root Cause**: Operators are attempting to increase efficiency and throughput due to pressure to meet operational targets and deadlines.
   - **Control System Issue**: The control systems may not be adequately compensating for inertia and momentum.

## Overheating of Motors
1. **Excessive Load Conditions**: Motors are overheating because they are operating under excessive load conditions.
   - **Root Cause**: Operators are lifting heavier loads than recommended due to a lack of proper load monitoring and control systems.
   - **Monitoring Issue**: There is a lack of adequate sensor integration or outdated control systems.

## Additional Issues
- **Sudden Stops Leading to Load Sway**
  - **Frequent Emergency Stops**: Sudden stops occur due to emergency stops or abrupt control inputs.

## Summary of Root Causes
- Inadequate control systems for speed and load management.
- Pressure to meet operational targets leading to unsafe practices.
- Insufficient sensor integration and real-time monitoring.
