  "prompt": "Solve the following problem: Gantry cranes find extensive application across various industries, employed to move hefty loads and dangerous substances within shipping docks, building sites, steel plants, storage facilities, and similar industrial settings. The crane should move the load fast without causing any unnecessary excessive swing at the final position. Moreover, gantry cranes which always lift excessive load may result in sudden stop of the crane. The crane operators' attempt to lift heavier loads at a faster pace has led to recurrent malfunctions, including overheating, and the increased speed has caused excessive swinging or swaying of the lifted load, posing a safety hazard.",
