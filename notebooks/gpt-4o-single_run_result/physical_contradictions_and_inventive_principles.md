# Physical Contradictions and Inventive Principles

## Identified Physical Contradictions

1. **Speed vs. Stability (Swinging)**
   - **Contradictory Requirement 1**: The hoist trolley needs to move quickly to increase operational efficiency.
   - **Contradictory Requirement 2**: The hoist trolley needs to move slowly to minimize load swinging and ensure safety.

2. **Load Capacity vs. Overheating**
   - **Contradictory Requirement 1**: The crane should lift heavier loads to maximize productivity.
   - **Contradictory Requirement 2**: The crane should lift lighter loads to prevent overheating of the electrical system.

3. **Load Capacity vs. Sudden Stops**
   - **Contradictory Requirement 1**: The crane should handle heavier loads to increase throughput.
   - **Contradictory Requirement 2**: The crane should handle lighter loads to avoid sudden stops and ensure smooth operation.

## Resolution Strategies and Inventive Principles

| Physical Contradiction | Resolution Strategy | Inventive Principles |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Speed vs. Stability (Swinging) | Separation in Time | 15. Dynamics, 10. Preliminary Action |
| Load Capacity vs. Overheating | Separation in Condition | 35. Parameter Changes, 23. Feedback |
| Load Capacity vs. Sudden Stops | Separation in Space | 3. Local Quality, 28. Mechanics Substitution |

These strategies and principles will guide us in developing innovative solutions to enhance the gantry crane system's performance and safety.
