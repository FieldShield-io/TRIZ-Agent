# Engineering Contradictions (EC) and Inventive Principles

In this step, we identified the Engineering Contradictions (EC) within the gantry crane system and derived potential inventive principles using the TRIZ methodology. Below is a summary of the contradictions and the corresponding inventive principles:

| **Contradiction** | **Improving Feature** | **Worsening Feature** | **Inventive Principles** |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Speed vs. Swinging | Speed of the hoist trolley | Stability of the load (swinging) | 15. Dynamics, 10. Preliminary Action, 13. The Other Way Around |
| Load Capacity vs. Overheating | Weight of moving object (load capacity) | Temperature (overheating) | 35. Parameter Changes, 19. Periodic Action, 23. Feedback |
| Load Capacity vs. Sudden Stops | Weight of moving object (load capacity) | Loss of energy (sudden stops) | 3. Local Quality, 9. Preliminary Anti-Action, 28. Mechanics Substitution |

These inventive principles will guide the development of solutions to improve the gantry crane system's performance and safety. The next step will involve discussing these options with the team to determine the most feasible solutions to implement.
