# Step 1: Defining Engineering System

## Gantry Crane System Components

1. **Gantry Frame**: The main structure supporting the crane, consisting of a bridge (girder) and legs that move on rails.

2. **Hoist Trolley**: Moves along the bridge, responsible for lifting and lowering the load, including a hook, cable, and pulley system.

3. **End Carriages**: Located at the ends of the bridge, supporting the crane's movement along the runway.

4. **Crane Runway (Rails)**: Rails on which the gantry crane moves, providing the path for the crane's movement.

5. **Electrical System**: Comprising motors, cables, and control panels, providing power to the crane and allowing operator control.

6. **Controls and Safety Features**: Includes the control panel and various safety mechanisms to ensure safe operation.

7. **Lifting Attachments**: Tools or devices attached to the hoist for handling different types of loads.

8. **Crane Running Mechanism**: Includes wheels and drive systems enabling the crane to move along the rails.

## External Factors

- **Environmental Conditions**: Wind, temperature, and other weather-related factors.
- **Load Type and Weight**: Different types and weights of loads being handled.
- **Operator Skill Level**: The experience and skill of the crane operator.

These components and factors interact to perform the primary function of lifting and moving heavy loads efficiently and safely.
