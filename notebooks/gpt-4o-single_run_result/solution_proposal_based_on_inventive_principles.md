2. **Redesigning the Hoist Mechanism**
   - **Rotational Movement Allowance**: Modify the hoist mechanism to allow the load to rotate freely, aligning with the direction of travel.
   - **Controlled Acceleration and Deceleration**: Implement smooth acceleration and deceleration curves using variable frequency drives (VFDs).

### Inventive Principles
- **Dynamics (Principle 15)**
- **Preliminary Action (Principle 10)**
- **The Other Way Around (Principle 13)**

## Overheating

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Enhanced Cooling Systems**
   - **Active Cooling**: Integrate fans or liquid cooling systems to dissipate heat from critical components.
   - **Heat-Resistant Materials**: Use materials with higher thermal conductivity for components prone to overheating.

2. **Adaptive Control Algorithms**
   - **Real-Time Monitoring and Feedback**: Implement sensors to continuously monitor temperature and load conditions.
   - **Power Optimization**: Use algorithms to optimize power distribution based on real-time load conditions.
