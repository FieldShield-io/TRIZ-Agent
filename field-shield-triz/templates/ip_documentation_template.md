# Field Shield — IP Documentation Trail

**Session**: [CHALLENGE_NAME]
**Date**: [DATE]
**Inventor**: Dylan Baribeault
**Organization**: Field Shield / fieldshield.io

## Purpose
This document establishes the inventorship contribution trail for innovations developed during this TRIZ innovation session, in accordance with USPTO guidance on AI-assisted inventions (February 2024).

## Inventorship Framework
Under current USPTO guidance, AI is a tool — the inventor is the human who:
1. **Framed the problem** and defined the design challenge
2. **Selected the approach** from AI-generated options
3. **Validated against real constraints** using domain knowledge
4. **Reduced to practice** by translating concepts into buildable designs
5. **Made significant contributions** beyond what the AI produced independently

---

## 1. Problem Statement (Human-Authored)

**Challenge defined by**: Dylan Baribeault
**Date**: [DATE]
**Description**:
[The specific problem statement as written by the human inventor]

**Rationale for pursuing this challenge**:
[Why this matters for Field Shield — business context, customer need, technical bottleneck]

---

## 2. TRIZ Analysis (AI-Assisted)

**Tool used**: Field Shield TRIZ Innovation Engine (Claude Desktop)
**TRIZ data sources**: Contradiction Matrix (39×39), 40 Inventive Principles, 39 Engineering Parameters

### Contradictions Identified by AI:
[List of contradictions with TRIZ feature mappings]

### Human Review of Contradictions:
- **Approved**: [Which contradictions were accepted as framed]
- **Modified**: [Which contradictions were re-framed by the human, and how]
- **Rejected**: [Which contradictions were deemed not relevant, and why]
- **Added**: [Any contradictions the human identified that the AI did not]

---

## 3. Solution Generation (AI-Assisted)

### Solutions Generated by AI Agents:
[List all solutions with originating agent]

### Human Selection and Modification:
For each selected solution:

#### Solution: [Name]
- **AI-generated concept**: [Original AI proposal]
- **Human modifications**: [What the human changed, added, or refined]
- **Rationale for selection**: [Why this solution was chosen over alternatives]
- **Human domain knowledge applied**: [What the human knew that the AI didn't]

---

## 4. Validation (AI-Assisted + Human Review)

### Constraint Validation:
- **Automated check**: [Results from constraint_validator.py]
- **Human overrides**: [Any constraints relaxed or tightened by human judgment]
- **Additional constraints applied**: [Constraints the human added beyond the standard set]

### Feasibility Assessment:
- **AI assessment**: [What the AI-based validation concluded]
- **Human assessment**: [What the human concluded based on hands-on experience]
- **Discrepancies**: [Where human judgment differed from AI analysis]

---

## 5. Reduction to Practice (Human-Led)

This section documents how the human inventor translated the AI-assisted concept into a buildable design:

### Design Decisions Made by Human:
| # | Decision | Rationale | Impact on Final Design |
|---|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### Prototyping Plan (Human-Defined):
[How the human plans to build and test the solution]

### Testing Criteria (Human-Defined):
[What constitutes success in prototype testing]

---

## 6. Prior Art Analysis

### AI-Discovered Prior Art:
[Sources found by AI agents during web research]

### Human-Known Prior Art:
[Additional prior art known to the inventor from domain expertise]

### Differentiation Statement:
[How the proposed solution differs from all known prior art]
