## 2. Human Contribution Points (Inventive Decisions)

The following human decisions shaped the inventive direction and output of this session. Under current US patent law (35 USC 101-103), inventorship requires a human who contributes to the conception of at least one claim of an invention. These contribution points document where human creative judgment directed the outcome.

### 2.1 Problem Framing

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contributor** | Dylan Baribeault |
| **Decision** | Defined the challenge as "full-spectrum novel wildlife deterrence" -- explicitly rejecting incremental optimization of existing deterrent approaches |
| **Date** | February 15, 2026 |
| **Impact** | This framing decision eliminated commodity solutions (louder speakers, brighter lights, taller fences) from the solution space and directed all five research teams toward cross-domain innovation. Without this framing, the session would have produced iterative improvements to known deterrent categories rather than the novel sensory-channel and ecological approaches that emerged. |
| **Inventive significance** | HIGH -- defines the problem space in a way that enables the resulting inventions. The decision to target unexploited sensory channels (seismic, ecological olfactory) rather than optimize exploited ones (acoustic, visual) is itself an inventive act. |

### 2.2 Direction Selection

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contributor** | Dylan Baribeault |
| **Decision** | Selected "full-spectrum novel deterrence" as the research direction over two alternatives: infrastructure-focused optimization and biological-only approaches |
| **Date** | February 15, 2026 |
| **Impact** | Ensured the solution space included multi-modal, multi-sensory-channel systems. A biological-only direction would have produced the cover crop border but missed the mesh network and seismic concepts. An infrastructure-focused direction would have optimized existing farm equipment but missed the behavioral science and biomimicry contributions. |
| **Inventive significance** | MEDIUM-HIGH -- the choice to pursue full-spectrum (all sensory channels, all behavioral mechanisms) is what produced the layered defense architecture, which is the system-level invention. |

### 2.3 Gate 1: Concept Approval

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contributor** | Dylan Baribeault |
| **Decision** | Selected 4 concepts from 25 candidates for Phase 2 detailed engineering; asked for rationale on exclusions to validate the selection |
| **Date** | February 15, 2026 |
| **Impact** | Determined the final concept portfolio. The human selected Distributed Mesh Network, Seismic Ground Vibration, Kill-Site Ecology Simulation, and Cover Crop Border + Layered Architecture. This selection, from a field of 25 candidates across 13 concept families, is a creative judgment that shaped which inventions were developed to engineering specification. Notably, the human approved ALL four AgTech Expert recommendations plus the layered architecture framework, validating the AI's ranking while exercising independent judgment. |
| **Inventive significance** | HIGH -- concept selection from a portfolio of candidates is a recognized form of inventive contribution. The decision to advance the layered architecture as a framework (not just individual concepts) is particularly significant. |

### 2.4 Gate 2: Validation Approval

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contributor** | Dylan Baribeault |
| **Decision** | Approved all validated concepts for final documentation after reviewing constraint validation, cost analysis, and safety review |
| **Date** | February 15, 2026 |
| **Impact** | Confirmed that the combined layered system (the recommended output) meets the challenge requirements. This approval step ensures human oversight of the final inventive output. |
| **Inventive significance** | MEDIUM -- approval of validated concepts is an exercise of judgment but involves less creative direction than the framing and selection decisions. |

### 2.5 Excluded Concepts (Prior Session Decisions)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contributor** | Dylan Baribeault |
| **Decision** | Banned 8 concepts from prior sessions (LITE, DRONE EXPRESS, ECOSYSTEM, HYDRA, Phantom Crop, Hunting Ghost, Magnetic Confusion, Economic Trap) |
| **Date** | Prior to February 15, 2026 |
| **Impact** | These exclusions constrained the solution space in a way that forced the research teams away from known approaches and toward genuinely novel territory. The ban on electric fence + AI (ECOSYSTEM) is particularly significant -- it pushed the team toward non-electric deterrence mechanisms (seismic, olfactory, biological), which are the most novel outputs of the session. |
| **Inventive significance** | HIGH -- negative constraints (what NOT to do) are a recognized form of inventive direction that can be as important as positive selection. |

## 4. Prior Art Analysis

### 4.1 Existing Commercial Deer Deterrents

| Category | Examples | Mechanism | Limitation |
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Acoustic | Yard Sentinel, Deer Off Pro | Ultrasonic or audible alarm | Habituates in 2-4 weeks |
| Visual | Nite Guard, Predator Eye | LED lights, reflective tape | Habituates in 1-3 weeks |
| Chemical | Deer Out, Plantskydd, Milorganite | Taste/odor repellent spray | Requires reapplication; rain washoff |
| Motion-activated | Orbit Enforcer, Scarecrow sprinkler | Water jet on PIR trigger | Habituates in 1-3 weeks |
| Physical barrier | Woven wire fence, electric fence | Physical exclusion or shock | Effective but expensive ($42-220/acre/year) |
| Predator urine | Coyote urine bottles | Predator scent avoidance | Habituates in 2-6 weeks; single compound |

### 4.2 Known Seismic/Vibration Deterrence Prior Art

| Source | Description | Relevance to Field Shield |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Geophone-based wildlife detection (academic) | Geophones used to detect large animal footfalls in conservation monitoring | Detection only, not deterrence. Field Shield proposes the reverse: generating vibrations to deter. |
| Vibration mole repellent devices | Small battery-powered vibration stakes for garden mole deterrence | Target species (moles) and mechanism (non-specific vibration) are fundamentally different from predator-gait simulation for cervids. |
| Seismic perimeter security (military) | Buried geophone arrays for intruder detection | Detection only. No published use of seismic transmission as deterrence. |

**Assessment**: No prior art was found for using artificially generated ground vibrations to deter deer or other cervids by simulating predator footfall patterns through soil. This appears to be a genuinely novel application.

### 4.3 Known Kill-Site Ecology Prior Art

| Source | Description | Relevance to Field Shield |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Commercial predator urine (Coyote Urine Co., PredatorPee) | Single-compound predator urine sold as deer repellent | Single compound; no decomposition volatiles; no spatial rotation protocol; no kill-site ecological simulation. |
| Landscape of fear research (Laundre et al., 2001, 2010) | Academic research on how predator presence shapes prey spatial behavior | Theoretical foundation; not applied to artificial deterrence systems. |
| Cadaverine/putrescine as insect attractants | Used in pest management to attract carrion-feeding insects | Different target species and purpose; not used for cervid deterrence. |

**Assessment**: No prior art was found for a multi-compound kill-site ecology simulation system combining predator scat volatiles, decomposition products, and visual predation evidence in a rotating spatial deployment for cervid deterrence. The concept of simulating the ecological aftermath of predation (rather than the predator itself) appears novel.

### 4.4 Known Mesh Deterrent Network Prior Art

| Source | Description | Relevance to Field Shield |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Wireless sensor networks for agriculture (academic) | LoRa/Zigbee sensor networks for soil moisture, weather, crop monitoring | Detection/monitoring only; not deterrence. |
| Distributed acoustic bird deterrents | Multiple speaker units for airport bird strike prevention | Single modality (acoustic); not coordinated with mesh intelligence; not cervid-specific. |
| Smart scarecrow / IoT deterrent (startup concepts) | Various IoT-connected deterrent devices with app control | Individual unit control; not mesh-coordinated emergent behavior patterns (encirclement, herding, ambush). |

**Assessment**: The specific combination of (a) ultra-low-cost mesh nodes with (b) AI-orchestrated emergent behavior patterns (encirclement, herding) using (c) variable-ratio reinforcement scheduling appears novel. Individual elements (LoRa mesh, PIR detection, piezo buzzers) are known; the system architecture and behavioral scheduling layer are the inventive contribution.

### 4.5 Known Layered Defense Architecture Prior Art

| Source | Description | Relevance to Field Shield |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Military defense-in-depth doctrine | Layered military defense with multiple barrier types | Conceptual inspiration; not applied to wildlife deterrence. |
| Integrated Pest Management (IPM) | Multi-tactic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical pest control | Philosophical parallel; IPM does not address vertebrate wildlife deterrence in this specific configuration. |

**Assessment**: The specific layered architecture combining passive biological (cover crop), ecological olfactory (kill-site), vibrotactile (seismic), and active electronic (mesh) deterrence in a single AI-coordinated system with variable-ratio reinforcement scheduling across all layers appears to have no direct prior art.

## 5. Novelty Assessment

### 5.1 Potentially Patentable Elements

The following elements are assessed as potentially novel and non-obvious:

| # | Element | Novelty Level | Patent Potential | Notes |
|---|---------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | **Seismic ground vibration deterrence for cervids** -- generating predator-gait vibration patterns through soil to trigger deer hoof Pacinian corpuscle detection | HIGH | STRONG | No known prior art. Novel sensory channel exploitation. Core mechanism is non-obvious (requires cross-domain synthesis of military seismic technology + deer behavioral physiology). |
| 2 | **Kill-site ecology simulation system** -- multi-compound rotating deployment of predator scat + decomposition volatiles + visual predation evidence | HIGH | STRONG | No known prior art for this specific combination. Distinct from single-compound predator urine products. |
| 3 | **AI-orchestrated mesh deterrent network with VR scheduling** -- distributed nodes executing coordinated behavioral patterns (encirclement, herding) on variable-ratio reinforcement schedules | MEDIUM-HIGH | MODERATE-STRONG | Individual components are known; system architecture and behavioral scheduling are novel. Patent claim would focus on the coordination protocol and VR scheduling algorithm. |
| 4 | **Layered defense architecture for wildlife deterrence** -- integrated passive biological + ecological olfactory + vibrotactile + active electronic deterrence with unified AI control | MEDIUM-HIGH | MODERATE | System-level architecture claim. Individual layers have varying novelty; the integration with unified VR scheduling across heterogeneous modalities is the inventive step. |
| 5 | **Thompson Sampling pattern selection for wildlife deterrence** -- using Bayesian bandit algorithms to learn and adapt deterrent pattern selection in real time | MEDIUM | MODERATE | Thompson Sampling is known in machine learning; application to wildlife deterrence pattern selection is novel but may face "obvious to try" objections. |

### 5.2 Trade Secret Candidates

The following elements may be better protected as trade secrets than patents:

| Element | Rationale for Trade Secret |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Kill-site compound formulations (exact ratios, concentrations, rotation protocols) | Formulations are difficult to reverse-engineer from field deployment; patent disclosure would reveal the recipe |
| VR scheduling parameters (reinforcement ratios, inter-trial intervals, reinstatement protocols) | Behavioral parameters are tuned through field data; competitors cannot replicate without extensive field trials |
| Thompson Sampling model parameters and training data | AI model specifics are proprietary advantage; patent would disclose the algorithm |
| Predator vibration pattern waveforms (frequency, amplitude, timing profiles for wolf, cougar, bear, etc.) | Specific waveform libraries are the product of research synthesis; difficult to independently derive |

### 5.3 Freedom to Operate Considerations

| Area | Risk | Assessment |
|------|------|------------|
| LoRa mesh networking | LOW | LoRa Alliance specifications are open; Semtech patents cover the physical layer but license is included with IC purchase |
| PIR-triggered deterrent activation | LOW | PIR-triggered devices are widely used; no blocking patents identified |
| Variable-ratio scheduling | LOW | VR scheduling is a fundamental behavioral science concept (public domain since Skinner, 1957) |
| Capsaicinoid aerosol dispensing | LOW-MEDIUM | Several patents exist for capsaicinoid-based animal repellent devices; claims are generally narrow to specific delivery mechanisms |
| Cover crop border species selection | LOW | Plant species selection for deer deterrence is not patentable; specific combination and deployment protocol may have design patent potential |
| Ground vibration generation | LOW | Tactile transducers are used in many applications; the specific application to cervid deterrence via predator-gait patterns is novel |

| 4 | **Assess system-level patent** covering the layered defense architecture with unified AI scheduling (Element #4). May be filed as a continuation or separate application. | Within 6 months |

### 6.2 Prior Art Search Recommendation

Before committing to patent prosecution, conduct a professional prior art search (estimated cost: $3,000-8,000) focusing on:
- Seismic/vibration-based animal deterrence (any species)
- Multi-compound olfactory deterrence for cervids
- Mesh-coordinated wildlife deterrent networks
- Variable-ratio reinforcement in automated deterrent systems

### 6.3 Publication Strategy

After provisional patent filing, consider publishing field trial results in agricultural extension journals (e.g., Journal of Wildlife Management, Crop Protection) to establish public prior art that strengthens the patent position and prevents competitors from patenting around the core inventions.
