## Field Shield Phase 2 Engineering Proposal
**Joint Engineering Team**: AgTech Domain Expert + Operations Specialist + Control Systems Engineer
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Deployment Target**: 50-acre blocks, northern US (USDA Zones 3-7 primary, 8-9 secondary)
**Budget Constraint**: $100/acre/year maximum for combined layered system

---

## PART A: COVER CROP BORDER -- PASSIVE BIOLOGICAL DETERRENCE LAYER

### 1. Concept Overview

The Biological Perimeter deploys a 20-foot-wide strip of deer-aversive cover crop species around the full perimeter of protected fields. This strip provides passive, zero-energy, zero-electronics baseline deterrence through three complementary mechanisms:

1. **Olfactory masking and repellency** -- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from aromatic species overwhelm deer olfaction and mask attractive crop volatiles
2. **Gustatory aversion** -- Bitter, pungent, or otherwise unpalatable foliage discourages sampling and creates negative associative learning
3. **Visual obstruction** -- Dense, tall growth (30-48 inches) breaks deer sightlines into the field, increasing perceived predation risk in the border zone

The biological perimeter is the lowest-cost, lowest-risk, fastest-to-deploy component of the Field Shield layered defense system. It can be planted THIS SEASON (spring 2026) using standard farm equipment, produces measurable agronomic co-benefits, and qualifies for USDA conservation buffer payment programs that can offset 40-100% of costs.

### 2. Species Selection

#### 2.1 Species Evaluation Table

| Species | Deer Resistance | Active Compounds | Height (in.) | Seeding Rate (lb/acre) | Seed Cost ($/lb) | USDA Zones | Life Cycle | Establishment (days) | VOC Peak Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ethiopian mustard** (*Brassica carinata*) | HIGH | Glucosinolates (sinigrin, gluconapin): 20-40 umol/g dry weight; hydrolysis products (allyl isothiocyanate, AITC) are potent mammalian irritants | 36-60 | 6-10 | $1.50-3.00 | 3-9 (annual) | Annual | 14-21 to canopy; 35-50 to full height | June-Sept (warm weather accelerates glucosinolate hydrolysis) |
| **Garlic chives** (*Allium tuberosum*) | HIGH | Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) + diallyl disulfide; released on tissue damage; 0.3-0.6% fresh weight sulfur compounds | 12-18 (foliage), 24-30 (flower stalks) | 4-6 (broadcast) | $8.00-15.00 | 3-9 | Perennial (Yr 2+) | 60-90 to establishment; full coverage Year 2 | July-Oct (peak allicin during active growth and flowering) |
| **Wormwood** (*Artemisia absinthium*) | VERY HIGH | Absinthin (sesquiterpene lactone, intensely bitter at 1 ppm), thujone (monoterpene ketone), chamazulene; total essential oil 0.2-1.5% | 30-48 | 0.5-1.0 (very fine seed) | $25.00-45.00 | 3-8 | Perennial | 90-120 to mature stand; persistent Year 2+ | June-Sept (terpenoid emission is temperature-dependent; peaks at 25-35C) |
| **Catmint** (*Nepeta faassenii* / *N. racemosa*) | HIGH | Nepetalactone (iridoid monoterpene): 70-99% of essential oil; documented 40-60% deer browse reduction in companion planting studies (Kimball et al., 2005) | 18-30 | 2-4 | $15.00-30.00 | 3-8 | Perennial | 60-90 to establishment | May-Sept (continuous during active growth; peak at flowering) |
| **Lavender** (*Lavandula angustifolia*) | MODERATE-HIGH | Linalool (25-38%), linalyl acetate (25-45%), camphor (0.5-10%), 1,8-cineole; 25-40% browse reduction documented | 18-30 | 2-3 (transplant preferred) | $40.00-80.00 (seed); $1.50-3.00/transplant | 5-9 (winter-hardy cultivars to Zone 5; not reliable Zone 3-4) | Perennial | 120-180 to mature (slow starter) | June-Aug (peak essential oil at full bloom) |
| **Marigold** (*Tagetes erecta* / *T. patula*) | MODERATE | Alpha-terthienyl (thiophene), limonene, tagetone; root exudates suppress nematodes; 20-35% browse reduction | 18-36 | 2-4 | $8.00-20.00 | 2-11 (annual) | Annual | 21-35 to canopy | June-Oct (continuous during bloom period) |

#### 2.2 Tier Classification

**Tier 1 -- Primary Deterrent Species (backbone of the border)**:
- **Ethiopian mustard**: Fast annual establishment, strong AITC-based deterrence, excellent biomass producer, suppresses weeds, biofumigation properties. The workhorse species for Year 1.
- **Wormwood**: Highest deer resistance rating of any candidate. Absinthin is detectable to deer at sub-ppm concentrations and produces strong gustatory and olfactory aversion. Perennial with 10-20 year lifespan once established. The anchor species for years 2+.

**Tier 2 -- Secondary Deterrent / Multi-Function Species**:
- **Garlic chives**: Allicin-based sulfur chemistry complements the isothiocyanate (mustard) and terpenoid (wormwood) deterrent channels. Provides a third chemotype for olfactory diversity. Perennial. Excellent pollinator value during flowering.
- **Catmint**: Nepetalactone is chemically distinct from all Tier 1 compounds. Documented strong deer resistance. Dense growth habit provides good visual obstruction. Exceptional pollinator habitat (highly attractive to native bees).

**Tier 3 -- Supplemental / Regional**:
- **Lavender**: Excellent where winter-hardy (Zone 5+). Not recommended for Zone 3-4 deployments due to winter kill risk. High visual appeal increases farmer acceptance.
- **Marigold**: Annual requiring replanting. Best used as a gap filler and nematode suppression agent in the inner band closest to the crop.

#### 2.3 Recommended Species Mix by Region

**Northern (Zones 3-5)**:
- Outer band: Ethiopian mustard (Year 1) transitioning to wormwood (Year 2+)
- Middle band: Garlic chives (perennial, hardy to Zone 3)
- Inner band: Catmint + annual marigold interplant

**Central (Zones 5-7)**:
- Outer band: Wormwood (perennial anchor)
- Middle band: Garlic chives + catmint mix
- Inner band: Lavender + marigold

**Southern (Zones 7-9)**:
- Outer band: Wormwood (may need afternoon shade in Zone 9)
- Middle band: Catmint + garlic chives
- Inner band: Lavender + marigold (marigold persists nearly year-round in Zone 8-9)

### 3. Border Design Specification

#### 3.1 Optimal Width: 20 Feet

After evaluating 15, 20, and 25-foot widths against deterrent effectiveness, land cost, equipment compatibility, and conservation program requirements:

| Width | Deterrent Effectiveness | Land Cost (% of 50 acres) | Equipment Compatibility | NRCS Buffer Width Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 ft | Moderate -- single-pass visual obstruction, limited olfactory depth | 2.1% | Fits most drill widths | Below minimum for most buffer programs (typically 20-35 ft) |
| **20 ft** | **Good -- 2-band design provides olfactory depth + visual obstruction** | **2.8%** | **Standard 10 or 20 ft drill pass** | **Meets NRCS CP21 (Filter Strip) minimum** |
| 25 ft | Excellent -- 3-band design, maximum olfactory saturation | 3.5% | Requires non-standard pass width or 3 passes | Meets all NRCS buffer programs including CP22 (Riparian Buffer) |

**Decision: 20 feet.** This width meets NRCS conservation buffer program minimums (qualifying for CP21 Filter Strip payments), provides sufficient depth for a 2-band species arrangement, and corresponds to standard drill equipment widths (two 10-ft passes or one 20-ft pass). The 2.8% land allocation is acceptable given subsidy offsets.

#### 3.2 Species Arrangement: Dual-Band Design

```
FIELD INTERIOR (cash crop)
|                                                            |
|  INNER BAND (10 ft): Catmint + garlic chives + marigold   |
|  - Shorter species (18-30 in.)                             |
|  - Dense, low growth blocks ground-level movement          |
|  - Allicin + nepetalactone + thiophene chemistry           |
|  - High pollinator value (catmint + marigold bloom)        |
|                                                            |
|  OUTER BAND (10 ft): Ethiopian mustard (Yr1) / Wormwood   |
|  - Tall species (36-60 in.)                                |
|  - Visual sightline obstruction                            |
|  - AITC / absinthin primary olfactory deterrent            |
|  - First contact zone for approaching deer                 |
|                                                            |
FIELD EDGE / PROPERTY BOUNDARY / FENCE LINE
```

**Design rationale**: Deer approaching from outside the field encounter the TALL outer band first. This band provides (a) visual obstruction that prevents deer from seeing into the field to assess crop value, and (b) the first olfactory deterrent layer (glucosinolate/AITC from mustard, or absinthin/thujone from wormwood). If deer push through or step over the outer band, they encounter the DENSE inner band of catmint, garlic chives, and marigold, which provides (a) a second chemically distinct olfactory barrier and (b) physical density that deer must push through to reach the crop.

The dual-band design provides **olfactory redundancy** (two chemically distinct deterrent zones) and **temporal coverage** (outer band annuals replaced by perennials; inner band has both perennial and annual species).

#### 3.3 Height Management

**Do NOT mow the border during growing season.** Mowing removes the visual obstruction function and reduces VOC-producing biomass. The border should be allowed to reach full height.

- **Spring cleanup mow**: One mow in early April (Zones 5-7) or late April (Zones 3-4) to remove dead material and stimulate new growth in perennials. Mow to 4 inches.
- **Post-season mow**: One mow after first hard frost to manage seed set (prevents wormwood from becoming invasive in some regions) and prepare for winter. Leave 6-8 inches of stubble for erosion control.
- **Mid-season exception**: If Ethiopian mustard bolts and goes to seed before August, a mid-season mowing at 12 inches followed by overseeding with a summer annual (buckwheat or annual sunflower) extends visual obstruction through fall.

#### 3.4 Edge Effects and Field Interaction

**Shading**: The 20-ft border positioned on the SOUTH side of east-west oriented fields can shade 1-2 crop rows during early and late season. Mitigation: on south-facing edges, use shorter inner band species only (catmint at 18-24 inches instead of wormwood at 36-48 inches). Alternatively, accept the 1-2 row yield reduction as an acceptable cost of deterrence.

**Allelopathy risk**: Wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*) produces absinthin and other compounds with documented allelopathic effects on some crop species (particularly tomatoes, peppers, and some brassicas). Mitigation: maintain a 2-3 foot unseeded buffer strip between the inner band and the first crop row. This gap also serves as an equipment traffic lane.

**Root competition**: Perennial species (wormwood, catmint, garlic chives) will extend roots into adjacent crop rows. Mitigation: the 2-3 foot buffer strip plus standard herbicide application in the field edge mitigate root competition. For organic operations, a shallow root barrier (12-inch plastic edging) is recommended.

**Volunteer management**: Ethiopian mustard and marigold can volunteer in subsequent years. Mustard volunteers in the crop field are easily controlled by standard herbicide programs. For organic operations, mustard should be mowed before seed set.

#### 3.5 Gap Management: Equipment Access Lanes

A continuous 20-foot border must be broken at equipment access points. A typical 50-acre field (quarter-mile x quarter-mile) has 2-4 access points.

**Gap specification**:
- Gap width: 24 feet (accommodates combine headers up to 20 feet plus clearance)
- Gap treatment: Install two enhanced deterrent stations (from the Mesh Network layer) flanking each gap. These active stations compensate for the passive border gap.
- Gap ground treatment: Apply microencapsulated capsaicinoid granules ($8-12 per gap per application, monthly) in the gap soil. Deer stepping through the gap contact capsaicinoid with hooves, reinforcing aversion.
- Gap count: Budget for 4 gaps per 50-acre field (one per field side)

**Annual gap maintenance cost**: 4 gaps x $10/month x 6 months = $240/field = $4.80/acre/year

### 4. Planting Protocol

#### 4.1 Seeding Rates and Methods

| Species | Method | Rate (lb/acre of border) | Depth (in.) | Row Spacing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ethiopian mustard | Drill or broadcast | 8 lb/acre (drill) or 12 lb/acre (broadcast) | 0.25-0.50 | 6-8 in. (drill) or broadcast |
| Wormwood | Broadcast onto firmed seedbed + roll | 0.75 lb/acre (very fine seed) | Surface sow, press with cultipacker | Broadcast; thin to 18 in. centers in Year 2 |
| Garlic chives | Drill or transplant | 5 lb/acre (seed) or 12-in. centers (transplant) | 0.25-0.50 | 8-12 in. |
| Catmint | Broadcast + press, or transplant | 3 lb/acre (seed) or 18-in. centers (transplant) | Surface sow, press | Broadcast; self-thins |
| Marigold | Drill or transplant | 3 lb/acre (seed) or 12-in. centers | 0.25 | 12 in. |

#### 4.2 Planting Date Windows by USDA Zone

| Zone | Last Frost Date (avg.) | Outer Band (Mustard/Wormwood) | Inner Band (Chives/Catmint/Marigold) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | May 15-June 1 | May 1-20 (mustard tolerates light frost) | May 20-June 10 (after last frost) |
| 4 | May 1-15 | April 15 - May 10 | May 10-30 |
| 5 | April 15 - May 1 | April 1-20 | May 1-15 |
| 6 | April 1-15 | March 20 - April 10 | April 15-30 |
| 7 | March 15 - April 1 | March 1-20 | April 1-15 |
| 8-9 | Feb 15 - March 15 | Feb 1-March 1 | March 1-15 |

#### 4.3 Soil Preparation

- **Minimum tillage**: One pass with a field cultivator or disc to 4 inches depth, followed by cultipacking to firm seedbed. No-till drill seeding directly into terminated winter cover crop is acceptable for mustard.
- **Fertility**: No additional fertilizer required for the border strip. The species selected are adapted to moderate-to-low fertility soils. Excessive nitrogen promotes vegetative growth at the expense of essential oil / secondary metabolite production (reducing deterrent potency).
- **pH**: All species tolerate pH 5.5-7.5. Wormwood prefers slightly alkaline (6.5-7.5). No liming required unless field soil is below pH 5.5.

#### 4.4 Establishment Period Before Deterrent Effectiveness

| Species | Days to Germination | Days to Effective Canopy | Days to VOC Production Peak | Year 1 Deterrent Rating |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ethiopian mustard | 4-7 | 30-45 | 45-60 | HIGH (fast establisher) |
| Wormwood | 14-28 | 90-120 | 120+ | LOW Year 1, HIGH Year 2+ |
| Garlic chives | 14-21 | 60-90 (sparse Year 1) | 90+ | MODERATE Year 1, HIGH Year 2+ |
| Catmint | 10-21 | 60-90 | 75-90 | MODERATE Year 1, HIGH Year 2+ |
| Marigold | 5-10 | 30-45 | 40-60 | MODERATE-HIGH |

**Critical implication**: Ethiopian mustard is the ONLY species that provides effective deterrence within 6-8 weeks of planting. This is why mustard is the backbone Year 1 species in the outer band. All perennial species (wormwood, chives, catmint) require a full growing season to establish and reach peak deterrent effectiveness in Year 2. The Year 1 deployment is a mustard-heavy annual planting; the system transitions to a perennial-dominant border by Year 3.

#### 4.5 First-Year vs. Subsequent-Year Management

**Year 1** (Establishment):
- Plant Ethiopian mustard in outer band (full 10-ft width)
- Plant garlic chives, catmint, and marigold in inner band
- Interplant wormwood seedlings or seed into the outer band in late summer (August) for overwintering establishment
- One mid-season weed control pass (cultivation or targeted herbicide)
- Mow mustard before hard seed set if going to seed before September

**Year 2** (Transition):
- Wormwood emerges and begins to fill the outer band
- Reseed any bare patches in inner band
- Ethiopian mustard may volunteer; allow it to grow alongside emerging wormwood
- Garlic chives reach full density
- Catmint reaches mature size

**Year 3+** (Mature):
- Outer band is wormwood-dominant (self-maintaining perennial)
- Inner band is garlic chives + catmint (self-maintaining perennials) with optional annual marigold interplant
- Annual maintenance: spring cleanup mow, post-frost mow, spot weed control
- Total annual labor: 4-8 hours per 50-acre field

### 5. Effectiveness Assessment

#### 5.1 Expected Deer Browse Reduction

Based on published companion planting and associational resistance studies (Nolte, 1998; Kimball et al., 2005; Conover, 2001; Swihart & Conover, 1990), and the documented browse reduction ratings for each species:

| Scenario | Expected Browse Reduction | Confidence | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 (mustard-heavy annual border) | 25-35% | MODERATE | Ethiopian mustard AITC deterrence is well-documented for brassica family. Limited species diversity in Year 1 reduces olfactory complexity. |
| Year 2 (mixed annual/perennial) | 35-50% | MODERATE | Wormwood emerging + full inner band provides multi-chemistry deterrence. Absinthin is the single most effective botanical deer deterrent in the literature (50-70% reduction as standalone). |
| Year 3+ (mature perennial border) | 40-55% | MODERATE-HIGH | Full multi-species border with 4+ distinct chemical classes. Wormwood at full maturity provides maximum absinthin/thujone emission. |
| Mature border + active deterrent layers | 70-90% | HIGH | The border amplifies active deterrent effectiveness by creating a persistent baseline aversion. Deer that have been conditioned to avoid the border zone are more susceptible to active deterrents (reconsolidation amplification). |

**Conservative planning assumption**: 30% standalone browse reduction in Year 1, increasing to 45% by Year 3. When combined with active deterrent layers, the border contributes to the 75-90% total system reduction target.

#### 5.2 Distance Effect Beyond Border

The olfactory deterrent effect extends beyond the physical border due to VOC diffusion:

- **Downwind**: Aromatic VOCs detectable at 10-30 meters downwind of the border under light breeze conditions (2-5 mph). This extends the effective deterrent zone into the field and outward from the field edge.
- **Upwind/calm air**: Effective olfactory range drops to 2-5 meters (border width only).
- **Practical implication**: The first 2-4 crop rows inside the border experience the highest olfactory protection. Deterrence declines with distance into the field interior, reaching negligible levels at 50+ meters from the border.

The biological perimeter is a PERIMETER defense, not a field-interior defense. Interior protection requires the active deterrent layers (mesh network, kill-site stations, seismic system).

#### 5.3 Seasonal Variation in Effectiveness

VOC production is temperature- and light-dependent:
- **Peak effectiveness**: June-September (warm temperatures drive terpene/glucosinolate volatilization; all species actively growing)
- **Moderate effectiveness**: April-May, October (cool temperatures reduce VOC emission; some species still establishing)
- **Minimal effectiveness**: November-March (dormant perennials, dead annuals; no VOC production)

This seasonal profile aligns well with crop vulnerability: most crop damage occurs during the June-October growing season. Winter deer damage is primarily on perennial crops (orchards, vineyards) which require supplemental active deterrence regardless.

#### 5.4 Interaction with Other Deterrent Layers

The biological perimeter amplifies active deterrent effectiveness through three mechanisms:

1. **Context conditioning**: The distinctive olfactory signature of the border becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) associated with aversive experiences from active deterrents. Deer learn to associate the border smell with danger, extending the effective deterrent zone.
2. **Vigilance elevation**: Deer that find the border olfactorily aversive enter a heightened vigilance state. Vigilant deer have lower startle thresholds and stronger flight responses to any subsequent stimulus (active deterrent activation), producing greater deterrent effect per activation.
3. **Approach channeling**: The continuous border funnels deer toward the equipment access gaps, where enhanced active deterrent stations are concentrated. This converts a uniform perimeter defense problem into a controlled corridor defense problem.

### 6. Economics and Co-Benefits

#### 6.1 Seed Cost Per Acre of Border

For a 20-ft wide border around a 50-acre field (perimeter approximately 5,900 feet):
- Total border area: 5,900 ft x 20 ft = 118,000 sq ft = 2.71 acres of border

| Species | Seeding Rate (lb/acre) | Area (acres) | Seed Needed (lb) | Cost/lb | Total Seed Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ethiopian mustard (Year 1) | 10 (broadcast) | 1.36 (outer band) | 13.6 | $2.25 | $30.60 |
| Wormwood (Year 1 interplant) | 0.75 | 1.36 | 1.02 | $35.00 | $35.70 |
| Garlic chives | 5 | 0.90 (inner 2/3) | 4.50 | $12.00 | $54.00 |
| Catmint | 3 | 0.45 (inner 1/3) | 1.35 | $22.00 | $29.70 |
| Marigold (annual) | 3 | 0.45 (interplant) | 1.35 | $14.00 | $18.90 |
| **Total Year 1 Seed** | | | | | **$168.90** |

Subsequent years: Marigold reseed only = $18.90/year. Perennials self-maintain.

#### 6.2 USDA Conservation Program Eligibility

| Program | Payment Rate | Border Qualification | Annual Payment (2.71 acres) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NRCS CP21 (Filter Strip)** | $50-150/acre/year (varies by county SRR) | YES -- 20 ft width meets minimum. Must be adjacent to crop field and provide water quality benefit. | $135-406/year |
| **NRCS CP33 (Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds)** | $75-200/acre/year | YES -- pollinator/wildlife habitat. Catmint and marigold are documented pollinator species. | $203-542/year |
| **CREP (Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program)** | $100-250/acre/year (state-enhanced) | LIKELY YES in participating states. Must meet state-specific criteria for buffer species. | $271-677/year |
| **EQIP (Environmental Quality Incentive Program)** | Cost-share 50-75% of establishment | YES -- cover crop and conservation buffer practices. One-time establishment cost-share. | $84-127 (one-time) |

**Conservative subsidy estimate**: NRCS CP21 at $100/acre/year for the 2.71-acre border = **$271/year subsidy offset**.

#### 6.3 Agronomic Co-Benefits

| Co-Benefit | Description | Estimated Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Erosion control** | Dense perimeter vegetation reduces sheet erosion from field edges by 40-60%. Particularly valuable on sloped fields. | Avoided soil loss: 2-5 tons/year on sloped fields |
| **Pollinator habitat** | Catmint, garlic chives, and marigold provide continuous bloom May-October. Documented to increase pollinator density in adjacent crops by 20-40% (Morandin & Kremen, 2013). | Increased pollination value: $5-15/acre for pollinator-dependent crops |
| **Soil health** | Cover crop root systems improve soil structure, increase organic matter, support mycorrhizal networks in the border zone. | Long-term soil quality improvement |
| **Biofumigation** | Ethiopian mustard residues suppress soil-borne pathogens and nematodes through AITC release during decomposition (Matthiessen & Kirkegaard, 2006). | Reduced fumigation cost for susceptible crops |
| **Beneficial insect habitat** | Border provides overwintering and foraging habitat for predatory insects (parasitoid wasps, ladybugs, lacewings) that provide biological pest control in adjacent crops. | Reduced insecticide application: $3-8/acre |
| **Aesthetic/marketing value** | Flowering border (lavender, catmint, marigold) improves farm appearance. Marketable as "pollinator-friendly farm" for direct-to-consumer operations. | Marketing premium: variable |

#### 6.4 Net Cost After Subsidy Offsets

**5-Year Cost Model (50-acre deployment)**:

| Cost Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Seed | $169 | $19 | $19 | $19 | $19 | $245 |
| Soil prep (1 pass) | $75 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $75 |
| Planting labor (4 hrs @ $20/hr) | $80 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $80 |
| Annual maintenance (8 hrs @ $20/hr) | $160 | $160 | $160 | $160 | $160 | $800 |
| Gap capsaicinoid treatment | $240 | $240 | $240 | $240 | $240 | $1,200 |
| Wormwood transplants (if seeding fails) | $200 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $200 |
| **Gross annual cost** | **$924** | **$419** | **$419** | **$419** | **$419** | **$2,600** |
| NRCS CP21 subsidy (-) | -$271 | -$271 | -$271 | -$271 | -$271 | -$1,355 |
| **Net annual cost** | **$653** | **$148** | **$148** | **$148** | **$148** | **$1,245** |
| **Net $/acre/year** | **$13.06** | **$2.96** | **$2.96** | **$2.96** | **$2.96** | **$4.98 avg** |

**5-year average net cost: $4.98/acre/year** (with conservative CP21 subsidy only).
**Without subsidy: $10.40/acre/year.**

This is the lowest-cost deterrent layer in the entire Field Shield system by a factor of 2-3x.

## PART B: LAYERED DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Architecture Overview

No single deterrent concept is sufficient to achieve season-long, habituation-resistant deer exclusion at $100/acre/year. The Layered Defense Architecture combines four complementary deterrent layers -- each operating through different sensory channels, different temporal patterns, and different levels of energy investment -- unified by a Variable-Ratio (VR) scheduling engine that prevents habituation across all layers simultaneously.

    DEFENSE SEQUENCE:

    (always on)        (ambient)           (if validated)    (triggered, VR-scheduled)
```

### 2. Layer Integration Design

#### 2.1 Layer 1: Cover Crop Border (Passive, Always-On)

- **Activation**: Continuous. No triggering mechanism required. Active during growing season; dormant in winter.
- **Role in defense sequence**: First-contact deterrent. Reduces the number of deer that attempt field entry by 30-55%. Every deer that the border turns away is one fewer deer that the active layers must handle.
- **Information shared with AI controller**: None directly. However, trail cameras at border gaps feed detection data to the controller. The controller learns which gaps deer prefer and adjusts active deterrent placement accordingly.
- **Interaction with other layers**: The border's olfactory signature becomes the conditioned context for aversive experiences from Layers 2-4. Over time, the border smell alone triggers conditioned fear responses.
- **Energy requirement**: Zero.
- **Maintenance**: 8-16 hours/year.

#### 2.2 Layer 2: Kill-Site Stations (Ecological Fear, Rotating)

- **Activation**: Continuous passive scent emission (wick-based). Enhanced by scheduled active scent puff events (solenoid atomizer) on VR schedule coordinated by AI controller.
- **Role in defense sequence**: Secondary passive deterrent. Creates a "landscape of fear" perception that the perimeter zone is an active predation zone. Deer that push through the cover crop border encounter evidence of "recent predator activity."
- **Information shared with AI controller**: Station scent level (capacitive reservoir sensor, $0.50/station). Trail camera detections near stations feed effectiveness data back to the controller.
- **Interaction with other layers**: Kill-site scent compounds (cadaverine, putrescine, synthetic predator fecal volatiles) are chemically distinct from cover crop VOCs, creating a layered olfactory profile: "aromatic plants" --> "something died here" --> "predator was here." This multi-layer olfactory progression is consistent with a natural predation zone ecology.
- **Station count**: 8-12 stations per 50-acre field, rotated to 3-4 new positions monthly.
- **Energy requirement**: 0.5W per active station (solenoid puff system). Solar/battery powered.
- **Maintenance**: Monthly scent wick replacement + station repositioning (2 hours/month).

#### 2.3 Layer 3: Seismic Deterrence (Novel Channel, If Validated)

- **Activation**: Triggered by AI controller upon detection events. Also runs ambient "patrol" patterns at low intensity during peak deer activity periods (dusk/dawn).
- **Role in defense sequence**: Novel-channel deterrent that operates through a sensory pathway (hoof mechanoreception) completely independent of the olfactory (Layers 1-2) and audio-visual (Layer 4) channels. This ensures that even if a deer habituates to one sensory channel, the other channels remain effective.
- **Information shared with AI controller**: Geophone detection data (deer hooffall detection at perimeter). This data provides detection for the entire system, not just the seismic layer.
- **Interaction with other layers**: Seismic activation can be synchronized with Layer 4 mesh network activation to create multi-modal (visual + acoustic + seismic) events that are 2-3x more effective than any single modality. The AI controller selects single-modal vs. multi-modal responses based on the VR schedule.
- **Deployment condition**: THIS LAYER IS CONTINGENT ON VALIDATION. A proof-of-concept feeding station trial must demonstrate that deer aversively respond to artificial ground vibrations at 20+ meter range before committing to full deployment.
- **Energy requirement**: 5-20W during active operation. Mains powered via buried cable along perimeter.
- **Maintenance**: Very low (no moving parts above ground). Annual connection inspection.

#### 2.4 Layer 4: Mesh Network (Active Coordinated Response)

- **Activation**: Triggered by AI controller upon detection events, subject to VR scheduling. 25-40% of detection events trigger a mesh response; the remainder are logged silently.
- **Role in defense sequence**: The primary active deterrent layer. Provides immediate, spatially coordinated responses that simulate intelligent threat behavior (herding, encirclement, pursuit). This is the "consequence" layer that pairs with the passive layers to create conditioned fear.
- **Information shared with AI controller**: All PIR detection events from all 100-150 nodes. Detection density map. Response-outcome correlation data (did the deer leave after this activation pattern?).
- **Interaction with other layers**: The mesh network is the ENFORCEMENT arm. Layers 1-3 create an atmosphere of fear; Layer 4 delivers the acute aversive events that maintain conditioning. The AI controller uses Layer 4 responses to reinforce the conditioned associations established by Layers 1-3.
- **Activation patterns**:
  - **Perimeter cascade**: Nodes activate sequentially along the perimeter toward the deer, simulating approaching predator
  - **Encirclement**: Nodes activate on three sides, leaving one "escape corridor" pointing away from the field
  - **Startle burst**: Single node near deer activates at maximum intensity (reserved for 5-10% of responses, provides sensitization events)
  - **Wave sweep**: All nodes in a line activate simultaneously and sweep across the field toward the deer
- **Energy requirement**: 0.1W average per node (sleep mode); 2W peak during activation. AA lithium battery pack lasts 1-2 seasons.
- **Maintenance**: Annual battery replacement. Monthly scent wick refresh (optional).

### 3. Variable-Ratio Scheduling Engine

#### 3.1 Core Algorithm

The VR Scheduling Engine is the unifying software layer that coordinates all active deterrent responses (Layers 2-4) to prevent habituation through unpredictability.

```
VARIABLE-RATIO SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
====================================

INPUT:  Detection event (which sensor, location, time, confidence)
OUTPUT: Response decision (respond/no-respond, which layers, which pattern, intensity, duration)

STEP 1: CLASSIFY DETECTION
  - Species classification (deer vs. non-target): PIR signature + thermal (if available)
  - If non-target (human, dog, vehicle): SUPPRESS all responses. Log event.
  - If deer: Proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2: COMPUTE CURRENT RESPONSE PROBABILITY (P_respond)

  Base rate: P_base = 0.30 (30% of detections trigger active response)

  Modifiers:
    Time-of-day modifier (M_time):
      - 0200-0500 (low activity): M_time = 0.8
      - 0500-0800 (dawn peak):    M_time = 1.5
      - 0800-1700 (daytime):      M_time = 0.6
      - 1700-2100 (dusk peak):    M_time = 1.5
      - 2100-0200 (evening):      M_time = 1.0

    Seasonal modifier (M_season):
      - April-May (early growth):     M_season = 1.0
      - June-Aug (peak vulnerability): M_season = 1.3
      - Sept-Oct (harvest approach):   M_season = 1.2
      - Nov-March (dormant):           M_season = 0.5

    Persistence modifier (M_persist):
      - First detection this session:    M_persist = 1.0
      - 2nd detection within 30 min:     M_persist = 1.5
      - 3rd+ detection within 30 min:    M_persist = 2.0
      - Animal has NOT left after prior response: M_persist = 2.5

    Weather modifier (M_weather):
      - Clear, calm:     M_weather = 1.0
      - Wind > 15 mph:   M_weather = 1.2 (wind masks scent, need more active response)
      - Rain:            M_weather = 1.3 (rain reduces olfactory Layer 1-2 effectiveness)
      - Fog:             M_weather = 0.8 (fog enhances disorientation; less active response needed)

  Final probability:
    P_respond = min(0.95, P_base * M_time * M_season * M_persist * M_weather)

  Note: P_respond is capped at 0.95 -- the system ALWAYS has at least a 5% chance
  of NOT responding, even in maximum-urgency situations. This maintains the fundamental
  unpredictability that drives VR conditioning.

STEP 3: BERNOULLI TRIAL
  Generate random number R in [0, 1)
  If R < P_respond: RESPOND (go to Step 4)
  If R >= P_respond: DO NOT RESPOND (silent observation)
    - Log detection event
    - Update deer pressure map
    - This non-response IS the mechanism that prevents habituation.
      The deer never knows if the next approach will trigger a response.

STEP 4: SELECT RESPONSE PATTERN

  Response selection uses a weighted random draw from available patterns,
  with weights adjusted by context:

  Pattern pool:
    A. Perimeter cascade (Layer 4 mesh)          Weight: 3
    B. Encirclement (Layer 4 mesh)               Weight: 2
    C. Startle burst (Layer 4, single node, max) Weight: 1
    D. Wave sweep (Layer 4 mesh)                 Weight: 2
    E. Seismic pulse (Layer 3, if available)     Weight: 2
    F. Multi-modal (Layer 3 + Layer 4 sync)      Weight: 2
    G. Kill-site scent puff (Layer 2 solenoid)   Weight: 1

  Contextual weight adjustments:
    - If deer at perimeter: increase A, E weights by 2x
    - If deer in field interior: increase B, D weights by 2x
    - If persistence modifier >= 2.0: increase C, F weights by 3x (escalation)
    - If previous response in this session used pattern X: reduce X weight by 50%
      (avoid consecutive identical patterns)

  Select pattern via weighted random draw.

STEP 5: CALIBRATE INTENSITY AND DURATION

  Intensity levels (1-5):
    - Level 1 (minimum): Single node, low volume, 2-second duration
    - Level 2: 2-3 nodes, medium volume, 3-second duration
    - Level 3 (default): 3-5 nodes, full volume, 5-second duration
    - Level 4: 5-10 nodes, full volume, 8-second duration
    - Level 5 (maximum): All available nodes in sector, full volume + strobe, 12-second duration

  Intensity selection:
    - 60% of responses: Level 3 (default)
    - 20% of responses: Level 2 (low)
    - 10% of responses: Level 4 (high)
    - 5% of responses:  Level 1 (minimal)
    - 5% of responses:  Level 5 (maximum -- sensitization event)

  The 5% Level 5 responses are critical for the sensitization mechanism:
  they exceed the animal's prediction of maximum intensity, generating the
  "worse than expected" prediction error that STRENGTHENS fear conditioning
  (McNally et al., 2011).

STEP 6: EXECUTE AND LOG
  - Activate selected layers/nodes per pattern
  - Record: timestamp, pattern, intensity, duration, detection location
  - Monitor for deer departure (PIR network)
  - If deer departs within 30 seconds: log as SUCCESS
  - If deer remains after 30 seconds: log as FAILURE, increase persistence modifier

STEP 7: ADAPTIVE LEARNING (runs weekly)
  - Analyze success/failure rates by pattern, intensity, time, and location
  - Increase weights for high-success patterns
  - Decrease weights for low-success patterns
  - Adjust P_base if overall intrusion rate is trending up (increase) or down (decrease)
  - Target: maintain 70-85% response success rate
    (not 100% -- some "failures" are acceptable and expected in a VR system)
```

#### 3.2 Training-Maintenance Protocol

Based on the behavioral science research (Section 1.3 of the Phase 1 behavioral science report), the system operates in two phases:

**Acquisition Phase (Weeks 1-3 after deployment)**:
- P_base = 0.80 (80% response rate)
- Intensity biased toward Level 3-4
- Multi-modal responses preferred
- Goal: Establish strong initial conditioned fear association with the field

**Maintenance Phase (Week 4 onwards)**:
- P_base drops to 0.30 (30% response rate)
- Intensity distribution normalizes per Step 5
- The Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect (PREE) ensures that the 30% maintenance rate produces SLOWER extinction than the 80% acquisition rate
- Occasional reinstatement events (1-2 per week at Level 5 intensity) prevent any drift toward extinction

| **L1: Cover Crop Border** | $524 | $419/yr | $2,619 | **$10.48** |
| L1: NRCS Subsidy Offset | -- | -$271/yr | -$1,355 | **-$5.42** |
| **L1 Net** | | | **$1,264** | **$5.06** |
| **L2: Kill-Site Stations** | $480 (12 stations @ $40) | $360/yr (scent consumables + labor) | $2,280 | **$9.12** |
| **L3: Seismic (if validated)** | $1,200 | $300/yr | $2,700 | **$10.80** |
| **L4: Mesh Network** | $1,020 (120 nodes @ $7 + hub $180) | $420/yr (batteries + maintenance) | $3,120 | **$12.48** |
| **AI Controller** | $350 (Raspberry Pi 4 + LoRa gateway + enclosure + solar) | $60/yr (cloud connectivity + updates) | $650 | **$2.60** |

#### 5.2 System Configuration Options

| Configuration | Layers Included | Total $/Acre/Year | Within Budget? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimum Viable** | L1 + L2 + L4 + AI | $29.26 | YES (71% margin) |
| **Standard** | L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 + AI | $40.06 | YES (60% margin) |
| **Premium** (enhanced sensors) | All layers + thermal cameras + radar | $55-70 | YES (30-45% margin) |

**All configurations are well within the $100/acre/year budget.** Even the Standard configuration with all four layers plus AI controller totals approximately $40/acre/year, leaving $60/acre/year of margin for:
- Enhanced sensor packages (thermal cameras, radar modules)
- Water jet consequence stations (borrowed from HYDRA concept)
- Additional mesh network nodes for denser coverage
- Premium scent compounds or advanced seismic actuators

#### 5.3 Cost Comparison: Field Shield vs. Traditional Fencing

| Solution | Capital (50 acres) | Annual Maint. | 5-Year $/Acre/Year | Effectiveness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8-ft woven wire deer fence | $30,000-50,000 | $1,000-2,000/yr | $130-220 | 90-95% (physical barrier) |
| Electric fence (8-wire high-tensile) | $8,000-15,000 | $500-1,000/yr | $42-70 | 80-90% (with proper voltage) |
| **Field Shield Standard** | **$3,574** | **$1,288/yr** | **$40.06** | **75-90% (est., layered system)** |

Field Shield achieves comparable effectiveness to electric fencing at similar or lower cost, while providing agronomic co-benefits that fencing does not.

| R1 | Cover crop border fails to establish (drought, poor germination, herbicide drift) | LOW (20%) | MODERATE | Use drill seeding for better seed-soil contact. Backup: reseed failed patches with fast-growing buckwheat. Border is not sole deterrent layer. | LOW |
| R2 | Seismic deterrence fails validation (deer do not respond to ground vibrations) | MODERATE (40%) | LOW | Seismic layer is explicitly contingent on validation. Budget is reallocated to enhanced mesh network + water jet consequence stations if seismic fails. System still meets cost and effectiveness targets without Layer 3. | MINIMAL |
| R3 | Mesh network node failures exceed 10% during season | LOW (15%) | MODERATE | Nodes designed for field replacement in <2 minutes. Spare nodes maintained (10% reserve). LoRa mesh self-heals around failed nodes. | LOW |
| R4 | Deer habituate to mesh network audio-visual stimuli despite VR scheduling | MODERATE (30%) | HIGH | The VR scheduling engine specifically prevents this through unpredictability. If detected (rising intrusion rate despite activation): (a) increase P_base temporarily, (b) add water jet consequence stations at high-activity entry points, (c) shift to multi-modal responses including seismic if available. The kill-site and cover crop layers continue operating independently of mesh habituation. | MODERATE |
| R5 | NRCS conservation buffer enrollment denied | LOW (25%) | LOW | System is cost-effective even without subsidy ($10.40/acre/year for Layer 1 vs. $5.06 with subsidy). Subsidy is a bonus, not a requirement. | MINIMAL |
| R6 | Wormwood becomes invasive in border zone or escapes into crop field | LOW (15%) | MODERATE | Mow wormwood before seed set in fall. Maintain 2-3 ft buffer strip between border and crop. Wormwood spreads primarily by seed (not rhizomes); mowing eliminates spread vector. In states where wormwood is listed as noxious (varies by state), substitute Russian sage (*Perovskia atriplicifolia*) or tansy (*Tanacetum vulgare*). | LOW |
| R7 | Kill-site scent compounds cause farmer/neighbor complaints | MODERATE (35%) | LOW | Cadaverine and putrescine concentrations are set at deer-detection levels, which are ~100x below human nuisance threshold at 10+ meters. Synthetic predator fecal compounds (PEA, TMT) are used at nanogram/m3 concentrations -- undetectable to most humans. If complaints occur: reduce concentration, relocate stations away from property lines/residences. | LOW |
| R8 | AI controller hardware failure (Raspberry Pi, solar, LoRa gateway) | LOW (10%) | HIGH | Redundancy: if controller fails, mesh nodes fall back to autonomous mode (each node triggers independently on PIR detection, no coordination). This is less effective than coordinated response but still provides deterrence. Controller can be replaced/repaired within 24-48 hours. | MODERATE |
| R9 | Wildlife (non-target species) adversely affected by deterrent system | LOW (10%) | MODERATE | Cover crop border BENEFITS pollinators and beneficial insects. Mesh network activation patterns are brief (2-12 seconds) and intermittent -- non-target animals (birds, small mammals) are unlikely to be persistently disturbed. Seismic vibrations attenuate within 30-50 meters and are below levels that affect burrowing animals. Kill-site compounds are predator-mimics -- non-target herbivores (rabbits, groundhogs) may also be deterred, which is a co-benefit. | LOW |
| R10 | Total system cost exceeds $100/acre/year budget | VERY LOW (5%) | HIGH | Standard configuration costs $40.06/acre/year with 60% budget margin. Even worst-case cost escalation (all components at high end of estimate range + no subsidy) totals ~$65/acre/year. Budget is not a realistic risk. | MINIMAL |

| Persistent intruder | Same animal (detection pattern) on 3+ consecutive nights | Activate all layers simultaneously for this individual; maximum intensity |
| Layer failure | Any layer offline >24 hours | Redistribute response load to remaining layers; alert farmer |
| Seasonal transition | Temperature-based growing degree day thresholds | Adjust M_season modifier; transition kill-site scent profiles (summer vs. fall blends) |
| Cost overrun | Monthly expenditure exceeds projection by >15% | Reduce consumable usage (extend scent wick replacement interval); reduce battery consumption (lower standby polling rate) |

### 10. Summary and Recommendation

The Field Shield Layered Defense Architecture provides a comprehensive, budget-compliant, and scientifically grounded approach to season-long deer deterrence at agricultural scale.

**Key performance projections**:
- **Year 1 browse reduction**: 60-80% (cover crop border + mesh network + kill-site stations, with acquisition-phase conditioning)
- **Year 2+ browse reduction**: 75-90% (mature cover crop border + conditioned deer population + adaptive VR scheduling)
- **Cost**: $29-40/acre/year (Standard configuration), well within the $100/acre/year budget
- **Anti-habituation duration**: Full growing season (6 months) sustained by VR scheduling, multi-modal stimuli, and multi-sensory-channel targeting

**The biological perimeter (Layer 1) is the recommended FIRST action**: it can be planted immediately in spring 2026, provides measurable deterrence within 6-8 weeks, costs $5-10/acre/year after subsidies, and generates genuine agronomic co-benefits. Even if a farmer deploys NOTHING ELSE, the cover crop border alone provides 25-55% browse reduction at negligible cost.

The mesh network (Layer 4) is the recommended SECOND action: fast to deploy, immediately effective, and provides the active consequence pairing that transforms the passive border from a "suggestion to stay away" into a "conditioned fear zone."

Together, Layers 1 + 4 at $17-18/acre/year represent the minimum viable product of the Field Shield system, achieving meaningful deer deterrence at a price point accessible to virtually any commercial farm operation.
