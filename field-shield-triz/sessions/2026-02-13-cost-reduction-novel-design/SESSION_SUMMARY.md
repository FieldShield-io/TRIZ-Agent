# Session Summary: Novel Wildlife Deterrent Design

**Date**: February 13, 2026
**Challenge Owner**: Dylan Baribeault
**Session ID**: 2026-02-13-cost-reduction-novel-design

## Challenge
Reduce cost and improve effectiveness of Field Shield wildlife deterrent. Current architecture uses $50-80K military-grade components. Complete architecture can be scrapped for a more effective design.

## Critical Discovery
Acoustic deterrents habituate in 3-4 weeks — the fundamental paradigm is flawed.

## Concepts Invented

| Concept | 5-Year TCO | Score | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **HYDRA** (AI-Triggered Irrigation) | $47,320 | 7.4/10 | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Phantom Crop (Aerosolized Barrier) | $88,452 | 6.2/10 | R&D Track |
| Hunting Ghost (Predator Mimicry) | $188,480 | 3.8/10 | ABANDONED |

## Key Patent White Space
- AI thermal detection + irrigation zone control + adaptive pattern variation = NO EXISTING PATENT
- US 9,226,493 (2016, basic motion+sprinkler) approaching expiration
- Phantom Crop botanical rotation has highest patent strength (8/10) if validated
